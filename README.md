# comp2911-project

A 2D platformer game where the aim of the game is to fly through a maze, collect coins, avoid enemies, and get to the finish portal.

Levels are randomly generated mazes using Prim's algorithm, which produces a maze with shorter paths and more deadends, or depth-first search, which produces a maze with longer paths for harder levels.
